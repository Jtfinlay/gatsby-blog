Hello! :)

I am a web and service developer based in Seattle. I bring ideas to life.

My skillset is in React, Node, and ASP.NET Core. I spend my free time building projects, spending time with my wife, and playing with my dog, Bagel ü•Ø.

I work for Microsoft on the Modern Commerce Services, but **this blog and opinions are my own**. I blog about technology, software, and entrepreneurship.

I am passionate about software. I firmly believe there are no wrong questions, and that learning drives a fulfilled life.

## Background

I am from Vancouver Island, British Columbia üçÅ. I have a BSc from the University of Alberta. I have worked at Microsoft for most of my career on Xbox, Office, Windows, and Commerce. Before then, I spent time at LoginRadius, General Dynamics, the Alberta government, and have also worked on neutrio-collision modelling with [SNOLAB](https://www.snolab.ca/)<sup>1</sup>.
